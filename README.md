# Exploring-the-Impact-of-Health-related-Twitter-CampaignsABSTRACT:
This study examines the effect of health-related Twitter campaigns on conversations around mental health from 2017 through 2023. The study made use of a sizable dataset of tweets about mental health and processed the data using a distributed data processing environment, such as Hadoop, MapReduce, before storing it in the proper SQL and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases. The emotive tone and polarity of the tweets were studied using sentiment extraction techniques, which made it probable to spot changes in sentiment over time.  Similarly, a comparison of the performance of two chosen databases, MySQL, and NoSQL (MongoDB), was performed to evaluate how quickly queries could be performed and how well storage was used.  Time-series forecasting techniques was used to forecast future discourse to identify trends and patterns in discourses on mental health. A dynamic and interactive dashboard was created to visualize the studied data, highlight key discoveries, and enable data exploration. This study aims to bring intuition into public insights and actions linked to mental health while also advancing our understanding of the effectiveness of health-related Twitter campaigns.
